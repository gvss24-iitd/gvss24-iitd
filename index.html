<h1>IITD Graphics &amp; Vision Summer School</h1>
<p class="h3">24 June &ndash; 5 July, 2024

<section>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>We are excited to host a summer school on computer graphics and computer vision at the CSE Department at IIT Delhi in summer 2024. This school is intended for undergraduates completing their 2nd or 3rd year to get a deep dive into the fundamentals of graphics and vision, and get hands-on experience in working on practical problems in these areas.

<p>The format of the school will be as follows:

<ul>
<li>The first week of the school will consist of daily lectures on computer graphics and computer vision, along with lab work related to the lectures and visits to non-graphics/vision labs of the CSE Department.
<li>The second week will involve intensive hands-on lab work on graphics and vision. It will also include a chat session with a panel of selected IITD CSE faculty, and a session on pursuing higher education (e.g. a PhD or MS(R) degree) at IIT Delhi.
</ul>

<p>Students who do well in the summer school will be invited back for internships in the following winter and/or summer.
